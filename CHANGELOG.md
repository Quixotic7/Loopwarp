# Changelog

## Sample metadata writes deferred instead of timer-throttled

- Replaced the timer-based throttle for trim/bpm/steps/gain sidecar writes with a dirty-flag approach: edits just mark the slot dirty and update the screen/engine live, with the actual disk write (sidecar file + pool-state snapshot) deferred until the sample slot changes, the page/category navigates away, or the script exits. Keeps scrubbing an encoder from ever triggering disk I/O per tick.
- Fixed the dead duplicate Source Sample-Editor item list: `page_items_for` now uses `lib/pages/model.lua`'s "SAMPLE" page data directly instead of a separately hand-maintained copy in `elasticat.lua`, removing the divergence risk that nearly caused the `gain` item to go missing from one of the two lists.

## Modularity pass (Phase 0 of the multitrack architecture)

- Extracted `lib/wav_reader.lua` (WAV parsing), `lib/script_state.lua` (dust/data persistence), `lib/pages/model.lua` (the page/category data table), `lib/pages/navigation.lua` (category/page/settings selection state machine), `lib/ui/param_values.lua` (parameter value/format/apply/lock runtime), and `lib/ui/source_page.lua` (Source-category rendering) out of `elasticat.lua`, which drops from 2241 to 885 lines.
- Converted `format_item_value`'s ~140-line id-keyed if/elseif chain into an id → formatter lookup table for the common numeric-display case.
- Deleted confirmed dead code: `draw_three_labels`, `draw_three_values`, `draw_two_pairs`, `draw_step_edit`, `draw_playhead`, `status_message`, `compact_value`, `short_mode`, `short_machine`.
- Updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to describe the new module boundaries, and added `docs/MULTITRACK_ARCHITECTURE.md` with the full 8-track target design and phased roadmap.
- Pure code motion — no intended behavior change.

## Per-page K2/K3 pair memory

- Each page now remembers its own last-selected K2/K3 parameter pair for the session instead of always resetting to the first pair when switching categories, pages, or returning from settings. Kept as in-memory state, not a norns param, so it isn't saved with the pset.

## Source page waveform and pitch ruler fixes

- Fixed the waveform trace itself overshooting the box at full amplitude by switching each column from a stroked line to a clamped, filled 1px-wide rect.
- Rebuilt the pitch ruler's dot/label placement to round the pitch offset once and lay out every dot and octave label from that single integer anchor with fixed 3px spacing, instead of rounding each dot independently. The old per-dot rounding let neighboring gaps drift between 2 and 3 blank pixels as pitch changed, which read as jitter; spacing is now always exactly 2 blank pixels. This also tightened the ruler from 18px/octave to 15px/octave (18 isn't evenly divisible into 5 dot/label gaps, 15 is).

## Source page header pixel pass

- Root-caused a class of "off by 1px" rendering bugs to `screen.move/line/stroke` on thin 1px marks (separator, waveform border, waveform markers, meter ticks/bars) rendering shifted or truncated in this environment; replaced every one of them with `screen.rect/fill`, which renders exact pixel bounds.
- Header background is a light grey (level 12) panel, 10px tall, with a 1px black separator at x=8 between the centered (0-7) track number and the message/tempo area.
- Page icon is a solid white 7x8px tag at x=120 with a 3-pixel dog-ear notch cut from its top-left corner, showing the header's grey through the cut.
- Header meter is a black 78x2px strip with dB-mapped live levels drawn in grey on top (dim below -12dB, brighter above -12dB), plus a fixed 2px-tall 0dB reference tick at x=71.
- Sample-slot cell redrawn to spec: a full white cell with a black 23x9 window cut into it starting at an inset of (7,1), the slot number centered in that window, and single corner pixels notched at the cell's top-left and bottom-left.
- Centered text in Source page single-line cells (STRT, END, REV, XFAD, etc.) instead of left-aligning it.
- Waveform box sits at exactly (1,23) sized 127x27 with a pixel-exact 1px border.
- Fixed waveform start/end/playhead markers overshooting the box: the vertical tick no longer extends 1px past the bottom edge, and the position-to-pixel mapping no longer places the rightmost position 1px past the right edge.

## Source page header

- Merged the two duplicate header-drawing wrappers into a single `draw_page_header(title, page_number)` used by every page (root pages, settings, and both Source sub-pages), fixing a bug where non-Source pages always showed page "1" and the Source main page showed the encoder-pair index instead of its real page number.
- Fixed the header page icon to render filled white with black text and black corner bevels, matching the sample-slot tab style, instead of an inverted black-filled box.
- Blank parameter cells (FILTER/AMP/FX/MOD placeholders and blank Source trim cells) now render as empty boxes instead of "---".
- Raised the SuperCollider status-report rate and the Lua redraw metro from 15 Hz to 30 Hz so the header meter tracks audio more responsively.

## Parameter pages

- Added a 128-slot sample pool with active slot selection, sample-slot parameter locks, saved pool state, and per-slot BPM/step metadata.
- Added `loadPoolSlot` / `setSampleSlot` engine commands so slot changes can switch resident buffers without loading from disk.
- Reworked Source page 1 into a Tonverk-style sample view with waveform, playhead, start/end markers, and compact value-flashing cells.
- Added Elektron-style parameter pages for MASTER, PATTERN, TRIG, SOURCE, FILTER, AMP, FX, and MOD.
- Added norns page navigation, active encoder-pair selection, settings-layer navigation, useful-value snapping, and page-header value messages.
- Added grid top-row category shortcuts with FN+category settings access.
- Added generic step parameter locks for page parameters, with held-step lock editing and lock clearing.
- Updated the root page renderer to a four-column, two-row layout with corner-only active-pair markers.
- Fixed category shortcuts to change both root and settings categories while the settings layer is active.
- Filtered Source page controls by the active Machine and active warp mode.
- Added persisted default trig length and velocity params, while keeping held-step edits as locks.
- Fixed held-step parameter displays to show locked values in the main parameter cells.
- Fixed active-pair corner markers so one corner is drawn on each controlled parameter instead of each selected cell.
- Added FN+category return from settings to the main parameter pages.
- Routed synced Master BPM edits through norns `clock_tempo` when clock sync is on and the norns clock source is internal.
- Kept playback-applied parameter locks from replacing master values on the main parameter cells.
- Preserved the selected warp mode when changing Machines and moved LoopTrig triggers onto the active warp engine.
- Added slice clock sync and slice rate controls; slice voices now receive the active warp profile.

## Machine sequencing

- Added user-facing Machines: loop, loop_trig, grid_slice, and razor_slice.
- Added pattern length from 1-256 steps, defaulting to 64.
- Reworked grid steps into trig records with optional loop locks, slices, pitch locks, velocity, and note length.
- Added mini keyboard pitch entry and step pitch locking on grid rows 5-7.
- Added triggered SuperCollider slice voices with one-shot, held, looping, continue, reverse, velocity, envelope, and mono/poly behavior.
- Added RazorSlice params for 32 precise start/end pairs; moving a start preserves that slice length.

## Elasticat v2 foundation

- Replaced the prototype all-modes-running SynthDef with one shared transport synth and one active mode synth.
- Renamed modes with accurate terminology while preserving legacy engine command aliases.
- Added immediate crossfaded mode switching.
- Added quarter-note Lua clock observations and bounded soft correction in the engine.
- Derived source BPM from loaded sample duration and declared sample steps.
- Added step/bar timing parameters, source sample BPM, and 0-128 sample start/end points.
- Tightened parameter increments for steps, start/end, pitch, timing, grain, and mode controls.
- Made tape playback independent of internal BPM and smoothed pitch/start/end modulation.
- Added chopped step slicing, chopped loop mode, and pitch-aware chopped playback.
- Updated the performance UI with shift-only metadata and a horizontal playhead.
- Added status payloads for phase, frames, RMS, tempo, correction, switches, realignments, stale observations, and load generation.
- Updated the test script for sample browsing, play/stop, norns BPM control, shifted mode switching, sample steps, and mode-specific controls.
